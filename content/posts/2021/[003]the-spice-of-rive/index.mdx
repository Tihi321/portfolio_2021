Welcome, in this article we will cover one of my favorite subjets, animations.Well a tool that makes possible to make interactive animations for web.

## Intro
Animation, more specific a motion graphics and design, defined a larged part of my life. Before web development, I worked many years in video production and large part of job was creating different animated graphics.

<br />

For that we used mostly [After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html), which is defacto industry standard for [motion graphics](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects/motion-graphics.html?promoid=L7NVTR46&mv=other) and [visual effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects/vfx-visual-effects.html). And to this day it remains one of my favorite tools.

## A New dawn

After diving into web developement, love for animation stayed. I tryed different technologies which enables you to add them to web, from [SMIL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/SVG_animation_with_SMIL), which is now deprecated, to [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) and [AnimeJS](https://animejs.com/). They are geared towards developers, so if you would like to create a banner or some motion in website, with prepared design and assets these are good quick choices. Though for that and even more, in general for animation in code I would recomend combination of [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), a really fun way to move the web with code. More on that you can read in these [articles](https://www.tihomir-selak.from.hr/category/svelte), where I covered them in more detail.


### Lottie

Though all of these tools above are not very helpfull in the process of design. When you are in the process of creating. So the process was, designers were creating animations in After effects and exporting in video format for us to implement, so it was double work. After a while we discovered [Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/), which was opened sourced by Airbnb. How it works is that you have [Bodimovin](https://aescripts.com/bodymovin/), a free plugin for After Effects, and runtime implementation for different platforms. You create animation in After Effects and export it in [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format, then refrence that file with lottie [runtime library](https://airbnb.design/lottie/#get-started) and voila, a magic.





When i saw that there was a tool which can replace After Effects at least for web, it is understatement to say that I was exited





[Rive](https://rive.app/) - 

One of the issues with trying any new technology is that not a lot of people tryied ti bofore you. The good this is that gatsby is flexible enough so you can develop it.
